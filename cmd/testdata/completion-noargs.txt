There are two ways to configure your bash shell to load completions for each session.

    echo 'source <(driverkit completion bash)' >> ~/.bashrc

2. Add the completion script to /etc/bash_completion.d/ directory

    driverkit completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/driverkit

Usage:
  driverkit completion (bash|zsh|fish|help) [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for completion
